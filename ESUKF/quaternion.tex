\section{Quaternions}

A quaternion is a generalization of the complex numbers $a + bi \in \mathbb{C}$. We can think of quaternions as defining a new set $\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C} + \mathbb{C}j$, and defining $k \triangleq ij$ we create can write any quaternion as
\beq
a + bi + cj + dk \in \mathbb{H}, 
\eeq
where $\{i,j,k\}$ are three imaginary units that multiply as follows:
\beq
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.
\eeq

Quaternions are powerful because they share many properties with complex numbers. Regarding quaternions as complex numbers with multidimensional imaginary part, we can rewrite every quaternion,
\beq
q_w + q_xi + q_yj + q_zk = 
\bma
1 & i & j & k
\ema
\bma
q_w \\
q_x \\
q_y \\
q_z \\
\ema
\eeq
We typically refer to this last vector as the quaternion and split it into its real scalar and imaginary vector components
\beq
\mathbf{q} = 
\bma
q_w \\
\mathbf{q}_v \\
\ema
\eeq
Continuing with this notation, we can now create an algebra for quaternions as follows: Let $\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{H}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
\beq
\alpha\mathbf{q} = 
\bma
\alpha q_w \\
\alpha \mathbf{q}_v
\ema
\eeq
\beq
\mathbf{p} \pm \mathbf{q} = 
\bma
p_w \pm q_w \\
\mathbf{p_v} \pm \mathbf{q_v} \\
\ema
\eeq

\beq
\mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{q} =
\bma
p_wq_w - \mathbf{p}_v^\top\mathbf{q}_v \\
p_w\mathbf{q}_v + q_w\mathbf{p}_v + \mathbf{p}_v \times \mathbf{q}_v \\
\ema
\eeq
At this point, we note that 
\beq
\mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{q} = - (\mathbf{q} \otimes \mathbf{p})
\eeq
Furthermore, we notice that the quaternion project distributes over the sum
\beq
\mathbf{p} \otimes (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{r}
\eeq
\beq
(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{q}) \otimes \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{p} \otimes \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{q} \otimes \mathbf{r} \\
\eeq
